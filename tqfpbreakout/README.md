#TQFP IC breakout board

This is a super basic breakout based on a 14mm-pitch TQFR IC footprint. It is designed to use 4 16-pin headers. All pins are numbered on the bottom side, and the outermost corner pins are numbered on the topside.

The TQFP footprint can be found in my fork of [The Keebrary](https://github.com/hineybush/TheKeebrary.pretty), the header footprint is from the default KiCad Pin Headers library.
